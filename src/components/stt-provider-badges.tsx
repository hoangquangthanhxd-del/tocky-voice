/**
 * The badge that tells someone why they would pick a given speech provider.
 *
 * Exactly one badge each, because each provider has exactly one reason to be chosen:
 *
 *   Soniox      → Best for Vietnamese
 *   Google Gemini → Free tier
 *   Deepgram    → Free $200
 *   AssemblyAI  → Free $50
 *
 * A row of four chips per provider says nothing — the point of a badge is that it can
 * be read at a glance while scanning a list.
 *
 * Shared by the onboarding step, the Providers tab and the About tab so the three can
 * never describe the same provider differently.
